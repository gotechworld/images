`MongoDB` is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, `MongoDB` makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in `MongoDB`. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables. `MongoDB` is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s.
